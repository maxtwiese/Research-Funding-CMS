## <a name="Motivation">Motivation</a>

As a Data Scientist I want to improve quality of life by increasing equity to healthcare and supporting medical advancements. Coming from another industry I have a steep learning curve that I work towards flattening daily. Coming from the military, specifically, I have a skeptical stance on the relationship between research subject (e.g. drug or device) and resource allocation. I aim to challenge my presupposition built from seeing pharmaceutical intervention pushed as paramount during my time in uniform with an honest look into the relationship between funding and medical research.

Data was obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) [Open Payments](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/about). Below are direct download links with descriptions of the data. In the EDA Crosswalk section, I will provide notes on how I came to certain conclusions and how you can recreate my findings. If you indeed want to follow along use these links to download each in a `.csv` format.
